This directory contains working examples of the Hugging Face inference API, inference endpoint and provider API.

The examples are grouped into Natural Language Processing, Audio and Video inference task examples 
inference endpoint and provider examples.

The inference_api_using_endpoint_conversational.dart and inference_api_using_endpoint_translation.dart files show
how to use your own inference endpoint for inference tasks.

To run the examples either edit them to use your own Hugging Face API key or edit the api_key file with the API 
keys as needed.
